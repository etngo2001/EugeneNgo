                    That's me! A self-proclaimed software engineer who loves to make random things and constantly learn new technology.
                    I'm currently a student at the University of Washington pursuing a Master's in Information Management. I graduated from the
                    UW as an undergraduate in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. I'm passionate about humane health technology and 
                    and really creating something that will positively impact peoples' lives. But to be honest, I just like making random things
                    that pop into mind that make me go "oh, that'd be cool." Feel free to head over to the Portfolio page to see some of the things
                    I've made so far.

                    Let's not forget the fun stuff though. I love hanging out with my friends and family, creating lasting memories that I
                    can look back on. However, I also really enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them better. Please don't hesitate to
                    reach out to me if you want to chat about anything - I'm always down for a coffee chat in the summers or a ski session in the winters.
                    I'm pretty easygoing and I don't like to take myself too seriously. I like a good balance of indoor and outdoor acitivites like coding,
                    video games spikeball, paddleboarding, tennis, and of course, skiing and snowboarding. Oh and I like writing :) nothing crazy
                    like technical writing but just brain splatter of whatever comes to mind as I type.

                    Not a super difficult challenge but try to find the easter egg on my page. It's a little something I added to make things a little 
                    more fun and also one of my favorite drawings that a dear friend of mine made for me. Anyways, that's enough about me. I hope you 
                    enjoy my page and feel free to reach out to me on any socials if you want to chat!
