<p>Whoa!</p>

<p>I’m kind of shook that I did this. Jekyll is amazing! Anyways, hi there! 
This is the start of my blog and actually, if you’re seeing this, it’s 
also probably the first day that my personal website has been up so welcome! I’m excited to
use my website to share with you my adventures and learning experiences.
I’ve already shared quite a bit about myself in the ‘About’ page so if you haven’t
yet, go check that out! Now that you’ve learned about me, it’s your turn to
reach out :))</p>

<p>I wanted to elaborate a bit more on my blog and how I’ll be formatting it. Going
forwards there will most likely be a mixture of ‘fun’ blogging and technical blogging.
I’m not sure what else to call it but as you know, I enjoy writing and I tend to write
the same way I talk: high-speed and energetic. Those will be my ‘fun’ blogs where
I’ll be giving life updates and things I’ve been thinking about; kind of like a journal.
I guess this falls under that category! Then, there will be my more technical blogs
which I will indicate with a [T] in the title where I will be giving updates
on my active projects and explaining the thinking and design process, supported by snippets
of code. I’ve decided to format this way just to keep things fun for me and allow
you guys to choose what kind of content to tune into and what you’d like to avoid!
Anyways, that’s all of this one so until the next post! BYEEEE!</p>
