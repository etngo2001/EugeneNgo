Hey guys!

Little life update because things got real hectic real fast! Big news tho: I GOT INTO
MY MASTER'S PROGRAM! I'm now a proud student in the University of Washington's
Master's of Science in Information Management. I'm on the early career accelerated track
with the intention to specialize in Data Science (and dabble in product management) and
I start on the 17th!  
So now what?  
Well, I will say that the two projects that I have under my 'active' tab are still being developed.
Slowly but it's still happening! I've been slowly teaching myself Godot and playing around in the
software. However, I do plan on actively taking advantage of being in school again and I
am focused on landing an internship. In fact, I hope I land multiple! So if you know anyone looking
to fill a machine learning or data internship, let me know :))  
Anyways, I promise my next blog will be technical so stay tuned for that! Until next time!
